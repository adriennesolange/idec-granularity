# idec-granularity

Secondary data analysis of UNC Carolina Affective Science Laboratory dataset examining the effect of emotional granularity on responses to acute stress. The primary goals of this project are to a) examine how trait measures of granularity relate to one another and relate to individual differences in responses to an acute stress induction, b) test whether granularity significantly moderates the link between physiological reactivity and self-reported emotion and c) explore the possible underpinnings of granularity in relation to interoception and context-sensitivity in the context of affective and stress functioning. Data and code are available within this repository.
